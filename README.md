Hello!

**This is my first ever project!**

I first started this project around August of 2021, back when I was just learning how to code. I found it again and decided to push it to Github.

It's a Cipher device; a lot like the enigma machines the Germans used during WW2. It encodes words differently each day, but a decrypter will always get it right no matter which day it's used!
